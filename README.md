# Statistics-projects
A small repository for some personal interest projects regarding statistics and modeling

This is a collection of some of my work in statistics, my primary interests are in modeling and predictive analysis for all sorts of data but especially sports and healthcare. If there are any questions about any of there projcets please reach out to me at reeder.nick@gmail.com Below is a list of my current projects:

- Regression analysis of College Basketball Performance
  - In this project I scraped data and built multiple regression models to predict the success of a College Baketball program. My metric for success was the Wins Above the Bubble (WAB), or where the bubble referes to the number of wins required to qualify for the NCAA National Tournament.
  - Two models were created: One with all multi-colinear terms removed to allow for analysis based on individual terms (such as 3 point percentage) and one with those terms included to maximize predictive power.
