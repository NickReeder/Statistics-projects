Performed a series of analyses to produce two linear regression models aimed at predicting a team's ability to qualify for the National NCAA Tournament. The models take a wide breadth of team statistics to predict Wins Above the Bubble (the number of wins required to qualify for the National Tournament). Model two had all multi-colinear terms removed as to allow the user to use individual features of the model to potentially improve performance; model one did not have those terms removed as to maximize predictive power of the model and increase accuracy. Both models resulted in powerful predictive capabilities: model one was able to predict within two games at 97% accuracy and model two with 93% accuracy.
